		<h1>Mitya</h1>
		<p>I am currently working on writing a game and maintaining some command line tools I wrote. I have been programming for over 4 years and although most of my experience lies in parsers I consider myself a generalist who will work on anything.</p>

		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<div id="portfolio_object">
			<a href="https://github.com/STEM-Olympians/speed-racecar">speed</a>
			<p>
				speed was an outreach program for a club, the aim essentially was to create an autonomous
				RC racecar, and I co-developed the algorithm. The algorithm was essentially a closed-feedback loop
				that took in LiDAR data from a sensor on top of the car, and deduced the possible directions to turn to.

		<div id="portfolio_object">
			<a href="https://github.com/dmitya26/crest">crest</a>
			<p>
				Crest is a tool that I developed to help me test basic static pages. It essentially crawls the site to check for
				status errors. I plan on adding ways to attatch processes to each path by adding more features to the DSL.

		<div id="portfolio_object">
			<a href="https://github.com/dmitya26/prince">prince</a>
			<p>
				Prince is a game I'm currently working on. It is essentially an rts tower defense about defending the galaxy.

		<div id="portfolio_object">
			<a href="https://github.com/dmitya26/abacus">abacus</a>
			<p>
				Aabacus is a backburner project that is nowhere near done that I don't really plan on working on in the coming months. It's basically a recursive descent (LL(1)) calculator written in C that was mainly meant for me to explore compiler frontends and modular commandline interface design.

		<h2>Other stuff</h2>
		<p>I play a lot of DayZ and am a reader of sci-fi and philosophy. I just started reading Dune and am on what is now my 3rd or so reread of Either/Or by Soren Kierkegaard. I am a Kierkegaard fan, and have also read his Fear and Trembling, Works of Love, am currently reading his Concept of Anxiety, and have Sickness Unto Death on my reading list. I am also going to read Wheel of Time on audiobook, which I am very excited for and will probably do over the summer.</p>
