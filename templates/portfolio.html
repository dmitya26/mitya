                SPEED was an autonomous racecar project I co-developed as a teaching tool for a program where we taught children about computers/sofware. This project was particularly complicated because we decided to make it without machine learning. The algorithm we used was essentially a deterministic closed-loop system that was fed LiDAR data. This had two major advantages over a machine learning solution. The first being that visually accurate simulation for testing the robot was not needed, as we only really needed to have a simulator that could replicate LiDAR data, which is incredibly easy. It was also a closed loop system, meaning it wasn't dependent on the data directly fed into it, but rather it self corrects based on the data fed to it, so a physical car would not in any way need to be accurate to the virtual car we tested on as long as the sensors weren't faulty. The last and final benefit is that we used lidar data, as opposed to camera data or whatnot. Due to the insanely low amount of data we're handling, along with the incredibly simple computation, along with the low volume of sensors, we were able to run the entire thing on a tiny computer that only cost 40 dollars.

            <p>mdp is an acronym for Markdown Parser. It's essentially a small parser and renderer I wrote for the document format known as Markdown. It does not have full syntax support, as that would take a while and I have other things to do, but it has italic and headings (the logic for all of the syntax is basically the same anyway with only some slight variations). My main goal with this project was not only to solve a real world problem that I deal with, which is that I needed an easy way to render markdown files in commandline, but also that I wanted something that I would be maintaining over a long period of time in order to look at how I deal with long-term problems. It's the kind of project where there's a lot of room for improvement in a lot of ways that maybe you don't find until you've been working on it for a little while, and whenever those problems pop up, I'm always very curious and interested in how they came to be in the first place. Overall, this project is just a programmers dream in terms of having to develop a tool that is actually usable, and seeing how that can go wrong and how I can improve my process.</p>

            <p>xchangr was an economy simulation bot that I developed a few years ago in order to simulate a governmnet economy. Back then, I was very interested with economy and government bureaucracy and was very obsessed with trying to replicate it. So I developed this economy bot. It operates on the platform Discord and you can interact with it via certain commands. You have the ability to lockdown  your account, your account can be frozen, you can transfer funds, you can create accounts, etc... I tried my best to emulate how that process would happen in the real world, so I did the whole works: multiplying floats to be integers to avoid floating point arithemtic errors, storing transactions in the ledger and calculating everything from interacting with the ledger, etc... I even started working on a credit scoring system but that was about when I stopped working on the project.</p>
