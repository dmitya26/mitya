        <h3>Preface</h3>
        I've only started reading recently. It started in the summer of 2024 with a little book called The Perfect Predator. <br>
        I thought that book was *okay*, it was interesting in the beginning, but towards the end, it became a bowl of brain molasses. <br>
        So in the times since, I've been reading a lot of philosophy, a genre that I am endlessly interested in. I started with, and am still reading/rereading Either/Or <br>
        by Soren Kierkegaard.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Completed</h3>
        <li>The Perfect Predator (I thought this book was mid as hell): A Scientist's Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug: A memoir, by Steffanie Strathdee, Teresa Barker, and Thomas Patterson - a memoir about the first man to be treated with a bacteriophage.</li>
        <li>(Re-reading) Diapslamata (The first essay of Kierkegaard's Either/Or), by Kierkegaard - Philosophical meditations and principles.</li>
        <li>(Re-reading) Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius - A set of philosophical principles considered the foundation of Stoicism.</li>
        <li>(Re-reading) Heraclius' Fragments - From what I could figure out, Heraclitus, a pre-Socratic greek philosopher who's primary philosophy was that change is fundamental to the universe.</li>
        <li>The Inferno, by Dante - An incredible poem written by Dante. It follows a poet, led by a man named virgil, touring the rings of hell. A particular pro of Dante's writing is his ability to draw such vivid imagry in one's mind.</li>
        <br><br>

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <li>Seducer's Diary, by Kierkegaard - Kierkegaard uses a fictional diary of a fictional man, a seducer, who uses manipulative tactics in order to get the girl he loves, in order to teach us about relationships and the human mind.</li>
        <li>The Republic, Plato - Considered one of the foundational works of western philosophy, </li>
        <br><br>

        <h3>Want to read</h3>
        <li>Critique of Pure Reason, by Kant - Here, Kant explores the possibility and existence of a synthetic a priori judgmenet, a judgement where the predicate is not contained in the subject, and where the truth is independent of the experience. An example would be "2+3=5" because both 2 and 3 does not contain anything which could make them relate to 5, and because 5 is independent from the equation which equaled it, "2+3".</li>
        <li>The Plague, by Albert Camus - A riveting tale of a place with the plague? Idk I haven't looked too much into it, it just looks really fun.</li>
